Object Analysis Toolkit (OAT) is a rules driven metaprogramming engine for arbitrary C# objects.

## Getting OAT
OAT is available as a library on NuGet as [Microsoft.CST.OAT](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CST.OAT/).

[OAT Blazor](https://microsoft.github.io/OAT/Blazor/) is an experimental WebAssembly app that runs in your browser and allows you to Author Rules and test them in a Sandbox using Objects instantiated from your provided Assembly.

## Documentation
Documentation for usage is on the [Wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/OAT/wiki).

Documentation for the API is available on [GitHub Pages](https://microsoft.github.io/OAT/api)

## Overview
* [Rules](https://microsoft.github.io/OAT/api/Microsoft.CST.OAT.Rule.html) contain a object Target, an int Severity, a string boolean Expression and a List of [Clauses](https://microsoft.github.io/OAT/api/Microsoft.CST.OAT.Clause.html) which are applied to the targeted object.
* [Clauses](https://microsoft.github.io/OAT/api/Microsoft.CST.OAT.Clause.html) perform a specified [Operation](https://microsoft.github.io/OAT/api/Microsoft.CST.OAT.Operation.html) on a specified Field of the Target.  The Field can be any property or subproperty or field of the object. For example, `SomeFieldOfTarget.SomeObject.SomeProperty`.
* Clauses can also Capture the result of their operation, to be returned with the applied Rule.
* The Operation set can be expanded with delegates.
* The object types supported by existing operations can also be expanded with delegates.

## Basic Usage

The basic usage of OAT is applying rules to targets using the Analyze function.

```csharp
object target;
IEnumerable<Rule> rules;
var analyzer = new Analyzer();
var rulesWhichApply = analyzer.Analyze(rules,target);
```

## Capturing

OAT also supports capturing and returning results of clauses.

```csharp
object target;
IEnumerable<Rule> rules;
var analyzer = new Analyzer();
var res = analyzer.GetCaptures(rules, target);
```

## Detailed Usage

A full [walkthrough](https://github.com/microsoft/OAT/wiki/Walkthrough) including creating a custom operation and validating your custom operation rules and capturing Clause values is available on the wiki.

## Authoring Rules

Detailed information on how to [author rules](https://github.com/microsoft/OAT/wiki/Authoring-Rules) is available on on the wiki.

## Delegates

Documentation for implementing each [delegate](https://github.com/microsoft/OAT/wiki/Delegates) is available on the wiki.
